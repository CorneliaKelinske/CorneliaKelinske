### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cornelia Kelinske. I am a Junior Elixir Developer located on beautiful Vancouver Island. I love building projects with Elixir and Phoenix and growing in skill as a developer.

Prior to working with programming languages, I ran a successful one-woman business in the (human) language industry, as a translator for English and German. While, at first sight, translating and writing code might not have a whole lot in common, there is a number of skills and qualities that carry over into this new career:

I am a highly organized professional who has never missed a deadline
I am able to work independently but also as part of a team
I appreciate constructive criticism
I am a good communicator
I am detail oriented
I enjoy challenges
I like solving problems 
I know how to search for solutions online (aka google it) and do not hesitate to ask for help when I am stuck

:mailbox: Feel free to contact me if you are looking for a low-maintenance junior dev.
